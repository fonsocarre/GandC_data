# Getting and Cleaning data project
### Alfonso del Carre

`main.R` is the main script. It reads the data in the original folder 
structure. This data has to be located in `<project_folder>/data`.

After executing `main.R`, only two variables stay in the workspace:
`reducedData` and `summ`, which are further explained in `CodeBook.md`.
